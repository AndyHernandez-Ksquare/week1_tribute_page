              Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer,
              mechanical engineer, and futurist. He was born on July 10, 1856,
              in what is now modern-day Croatia, and he passed away on January
              7, 1943, in New York City.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tesla is most famous for his work with alternating current (AC)
              electrical systems. He invented the Tesla coil, which is still
              used in radio technology today.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on
              alternating current. This motor is widely considered to be one of
              his greatest achievements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tesla was known for his eccentric behavior, including his aversion
              to germs and his habit of working from 3 a.m. until 11 p.m.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tesla was a polyglot and spoke eight languages fluently, including
              Serbo-Croatian, English, Czech, French, German, Hungarian,
              Italian, and Latin.
